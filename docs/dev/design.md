# Design

UI constraints for shared Blazor clients. Code layout: [architecture.md - UI guidelines](architecture.md#ui-guidelines-summary).

## Audience

Small private installs: the owner plus family/friends. Same people on desktop, phone, and TV (remote / 10-foot). No cloud SaaS assumptions.

## Look and feel

- Dark mode is the default (deep blue-gray canvas, roughly `#0c1018`-`#131821`). Light mode must be equally usable, not a harsh invert.
- Media artwork (posters, covers, stills) carries the UI. Chrome stays quiet; do not decorate over the content.
- Ambient color (player backdrop, album hero blur) comes from the media when possible, not from a fixed brand palette.
- Accent is copper (`#CC7A3E`) via CSS tokens only - never hard-coded hex in components. Hex values in this doc are token references only.
- Fonts: Epilogue for headings, Manrope for body (`--font-heading` / `--font-body`). Do not use Inter/Roboto/Arial or monospace as a style gimmick.

Component catalog: [developing.md - DesignSystem](developing.md#designsystem).

## Rules

1. Prefer artwork and playback over chrome. Drop UI that does not help find or play media.
2. No neon, glow, decorative gradients, or cyan/purple "AI" accents.
3. Desktop, mobile, and couch each need a real interaction model - do not only scale down the desktop layout.
4. Colors, spacing, and type that matter go through design tokens (themes are a product feature).
5. WCAG AA minimum: contrast, keyboard/spatial focus, semantic controls. Keep core features available on small screens.

## Avoid

- Glassmorphism, gradient text, identical card grids, nested cards, hero-metric dashboards
- Bounce/elastic easing; gray text on colored backgrounds; pure `#000` / `#fff`
- Hiding primary actions behind mobile-only overflow menus when desktop shows them plainly
